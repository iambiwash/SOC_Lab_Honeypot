🏠 Home SOC Lab in Azure: Cybersecurity Project

📌 Overview

This project is designed to help cybersecurity enthusiasts set up a basic home SOC (Security Operations Center) lab using Microsoft Azure. The lab involves creating a honeypot—a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine (VM)—that attracts attackers. By monitoring attack attempts in real-time, participants can learn about log analysis, threat detection, and security monitoring, making it an excellent hands-on project for a cybersecurity resume.

🎯 Purpose

The goal of this lab is to:

🚀 Deploy a honeypot VM on Azure that is open to public internet attacks.

📊 Collect and analyze attack logs using a centralized logging system.

🔎 Connect logs to Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) for interactive analysis.

🗺️ Visualize attack origins on a map using IP geolocation data.

This setup mimics real-world security operations and helps users understand how security teams detect and respond to threats.


🛠️ Project Scope



1️⃣ Setting Up Azure Environment

🔹 Create a free Azure subscription (or use pay-as-you-go).

🔹 Set up a resource group to organize cloud resources.

🔹 Deploy a Windows-based Virtual Machine (VM) to act as a honeypot.



2️⃣ Configuring Network Security

🔹 Create a virtual network to connect the VM.

🔹 Disable all firewalls to make the honeypot attractive to attackers.

🔹 Modify the network security group (NSG) to allow all inbound traffic.



3️⃣ Log Management & Forwarding

🔹 Use Windows Event Viewer to check failed login attempts.

🔹 Configure Log Analytics Workspace as a central log repository.

🔹 Integrate Azure Monitor Agent to forward logs to Microsoft Sentinel.



4️⃣ Analyzing Attacks with SIEM

🔹 Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) to filter logs and identify failed login attempts.

🔹 Create a watchlist of attacker IP addresses and map them to geographic locations.

🔹 Visualize attack patterns using an interactive dashboard in Sentinel.
